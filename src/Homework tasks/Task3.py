# Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.

'''= is an assignment operator. It is used to assign values to a variable.
 == is an comparison operator. It is used to compare the two values to see if they are equal or not'''

# What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?

'''** is used for expontential
Syntax: base_variable ** exponent_variable
eg: 2 ** 3--->2*2*2=8'''

# What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
'''^ is used for xor
if any one is true it returns true ,otherwise if falls
If both bits are different, the resulting bit is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0. 
The ^ operator is commonly used in contexts like: 
Cryptography: For encrypting and decrypting data using XOR operations
Bit manipulation: For performing operations on individual bits of a number Checking for unique elements in a list or set
eg: 1 0 -->1 True
    0  1 -->1 True'''
